THINGS TO DO

1) Write the pseudocode of the algorithm
2) Write the reason for choosing standard deviation
3) Write about comparison between algorithms - with and without baseline
5) Check code properly, comment the code
6) Check if the saved policy works, check if the code generates similar results on training for those hyperparameters
7) Package the files properly in a zip file
